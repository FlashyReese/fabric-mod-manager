# Fabric Mod Manager
Fabric Mod Manager is a do-all mod manager written in Java for Fabric. It is currently being developed, and it is at its early stages of development.

NOTE: This is will only be able update mods that have opted-in for the [Fabric Mod Repository](https://github.com/FlashyReese/fabric-mod-repository)!

## Getting Started
Use `gradlew shadowJar` to build project.




Now I'm convinced that I should have written this with C++.
